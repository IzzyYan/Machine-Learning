## Binary Search
```python
def binary_search(list, item):
  # low and high keep track of which part of the list you'll search in.
  low = 0
  high = len(list) - 1

  # While you haven't narrowed it down to one element ...
  while low <= high:
    # ... check the middle element
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    guess = list[mid]
    # Found the item.
    if guess == item:
      return mid
    # The guess was too high.
    if guess > item:
      high = mid - 1
    # The guess was too low.
    else:
      low = mid + 1

  # Item doesn't exist
  return None

my_list = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print(binary_search(my_list, 9)) # => 4

# 'None' means nil in Python. We use to indicate that the item wasn't found.
print(binary_search(my_list, -1)) # => None

# Binary search在有序列表中最多需要检查log n个元素。e.g. 1024个元素，最多需要检查10个元素，因为log 1024 = 10
```
O(logn): 对数时间，binary search
O(n): 线性时间，linear search
O(n*logn)快速排序, quicksort
O(n**2)选择排序, selection sort
O(n!) traveling salesman problem

## Selection Sort
array(数组)：元素都在一起。**读取速度快**
list(链表)：元素分开，每个元素存储下一个元素地址。**插入和删除速度快**

## 递归(Recurrsion)
